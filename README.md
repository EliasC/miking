Miking (Meta vIKING) is a meta language system for creating embedded
domain-specific and general-purpose languages.

Miking is not a programming language, but rather a language system for
creating languages and generating efficient compilers.


## MCore
MCore (Miking Core) is the core language of the Miking system. It is based on a typed Lambda Calculus. Unique features of the MCore language are:

* The **Dive** operator that enables runtime partial evaluation and meta programming.
* The **Compose** operator that makes it possible to compose new languages from existing language fragments.
* **Unified Collection Types (UC Types)**, a unified approach to handle standard collections, such as sequences, lists, maps, multisets, sets, and more.

The rest of this document gives a brief overview of the MCore language.

### Syntax
One of the design objectives of MCore is to make the concrete syntax very close to the abstract syntax of the language. That is, no syntactic sugar is introduced to the concrete MCore syntax. The MCore language is not intended to be a general purpose programming language, but a core language to which other languages translate into.

### Unfied Collection Types (UC Types)

UC Types unify the concepts typically implemented in abstract data types such as lists, maps, and sets. Instead of being different data types, there is one unified type with two different properties: **Order** and **Uniqueness**.

**Property 1 (Order):**

* Unordered (U)
* Ordered (O)
* Sorted (S)

**Property 2 (Uniqueness):**

* Unique (Q)
* Multivalued (M)

Each combination of the two properties form a *specific* collection type:

1. Properties *Unordered* and *Unique* forms a **Set**
2. Properties *Unordered* and *Multivalued* forms a **Multi Set**
3. Properties *Ordered* and *Unique* forms a **Unique Sequence**
4. Properties *Ordered* and *Multivalued* forms a **Sequence**
5. Properties *Sorted* and *Unique* forms a **Sorted Set**
6. Properties *Sorted* and *Multivalued* forms a **Sorted Multi Set**

Each of these collection types can then be used as other standard data type. For instance, a sequence can be used as a list, an immutable array, a queue, or a stack. Functional maps can be defined using sets, where the values are maplets (only the key of a maplet is compared). Priority queues can be created using maplets and sorted sets.

UC types have many different intrinsic functions (built-in functions), where some of them are only valid for some of the 6 specific collection types. Moreover, there are some operations defined on the *composition* of collection types. For instance, a matrix can be defined as a sequence of sequences, where matrix multiplication is defined on such a type.


## MCore+

MCore+ extends MCore with a number of syntactic sugar extensions.

### Inference of Self Variables

The following program in MCore+ 

```
let m1 = {
  let foo = 7 
}
let x = m1.foo  // x contains value 7
```
is a syntactic simplification, where the self variables have been derived. In the following MCore version, the two self variables `s` and `root` are explicit.

```
let m1 = self s {
  let foo = 7
  let x = s.foo + 1   // x evaluates to 8
}
let y = root.m1.foo   // y evaluates to 7
```

In the above MCore code, the top level module was implicit, using a default self variable called `root`. In the following code, this module is explicit:

```
self root {
  let m1 = self s {
    let foo = 7
    let x = s.foo + 1   // x evaluates to 8
  }
  let y = root.m1.foo   // y evaluates to 7
}
```
